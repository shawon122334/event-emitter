Event Emitter 

What is event? event emit? event listen?
    - Its an activity. Front end : click, double-click, hover -> perform something against these
    - example : emit and listen
              : my button -> click (event) -> js function triggers(emit) 
              : (js function is listening when to trigger )
              

why do we need it? 
    -we have to define *all the events* in call back , but we can define many listeners individually using event emitter
    - in call back , we have to write all codes and execute everything(unless we write more cb) in there, 
    but, we can split code(more listeners) using event and execute code partially (we can define which code to execute and which not to execute)
